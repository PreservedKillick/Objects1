Epicodus: Week2, Day1

Day one of object-oriented Javascript.

Progress:
Used address book example in the lesson to create own project on baseball teams and their home cities.  Then tackled assigned projects.  


*******
Lesson:

Triangle tracker

If you finish the address book, you can work on another page to categorize triangles for a user. If a user enters an invalid triangle, pop up an alert when they try to submit the form.

You'll only need one prototype for this page: Triangle. Make a method called type that tells what type of triangle it is, and a method called invalid that returns a boolean telling if it's invalid.


Shipping rate calculator

Make a web page that calculates the cost of shipping a package. You can make up the rules about calculating costs; use the Fedex shipping calculator for inspiration about what kind of information to gather. Again, use objects to embody your logic - you can solve this with a single prototype for Package.
